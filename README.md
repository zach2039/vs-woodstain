Wood Stain
=================

Overview
--------

Adds the ability to stain wood; create colorful wooden plank variants from any wood type.

Blocks, slabs, and stairs are stainable using a brush coated in any dye color.

Note that stained planks cannot currently be sawed back down into planks.


Quick-start Guide
--------

1. Create a stain brush with sticks and a normal linen sheet.

2. Create dye and either right-click a bucket of dye with the created brush, or place the created brush in a barrel of dye.

3. Right-click unstained wood blocks in the world to stain them!

4. Wash the brush off for new coats of stain by placing them in clean water barrels or right-clicking buckets of water.
